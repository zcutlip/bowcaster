Bowcaster Exploit Development Framework

This framework, implemented in Python, is intended to aid those developing
exploits by providing useful set of tools and modules, such as payloads,
encoders, connect-back servers, etc.  Currently the framework is focused on the
MIPS CPU architecture, but the design is intended to be modular enough to
support arbitrary architectures.

To install, run:
python setup.py install
